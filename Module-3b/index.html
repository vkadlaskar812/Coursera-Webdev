      <h3 class="text-center" id="chicken">Chicken</h3>
      <p >Broilers, fryers, and roasters can generally be used interchangeably based on how much meat you think you'll need. They are young chickens raised only for their meat, so they are fine to use for any preparation from poaching to roasting. You may need to adjust cooking times or amounts of other ingredients (like stuffing) based on what the recipe called for and the size of your chicken. Stewing chickens are usually laying hens that have passed their prime. They are older and their meat is usually tougher and more stringy. This type of chicken is best used in stews (as the name implies!) where the meat has time to break down during the long, moist cooking. Since they've been castrated, capons don't develop in the normal way of a hormone-crazy chicken teenager. They grow more slowly and put on more body fat. Because of this, their meat is more tender and flavorful than that of any other chicken of the same weight. Capons are great for roasting but can also be used for braises and poaching. Roosters are tough old birds with low body fat and lean, ropey muscles. They're rarely found in chain grocery stores, but can be found in specialty markets and many Asian markets. Like stewing chickens, roosters are best used in slow cooked stews and braises, like the traditional Coq au Vin. <a href="#menu" class="visible-xs">Back To Top</a> </p>

      <h3 class="text-center" id="beef">Beef</h3>
      <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. Beef can be harvested from bulls, heifers or steers. Its acceptability as a food source varies in different parts of the world.
          Beef muscle meat can be cut into roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.) Some cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky), and trimmings, usually mixed with meat from older, leaner cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties of blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as-is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Beef from steers and heifers is very similar. According to the most recent National Beef Quality Audit, heifer carcasses had slightly more marbling than steer carcasses, but USDA quality grade was not significantly different.<a href="#menu" class="visible-xs">Back To Top</a></p>

      <h3 class="text-center" id="sushi">Sushi</h3>
      <p>This shrine to Japanese cuisine offers much more than sushi and sashimi. At Kyoto Garden Sushi fresh seafood is the specialty, with no net unturned in sourcing top-quality, unusual ingredients from around the world, from farmed abalone to Mozambican conch, eel, sea urchin, and even Alaskan king crab, deep-sea scallops and wild salmon.
      Exquisite combinations – imagine sake-steamed clams – capture the subtle tastes and textures of Japanese cuisine. Enjoy superb sushi from the bar. Try the signature clear broth called ‘the sea’ or crayfish miso soup, and the feather-light tempura scallops, vegetables, prawns and oysters.
      The combinations are innovative, the flavours fresh and delicate. The fare reflects the savoury essence of umami in stocks and dressings infused with mirin, dashi, ponzu, ginger and soy. Vegetarians are spoiled for choice with fresh seaweed salad with shitake mushrooms, vegetable tempura and exotic mushroom dishes.
      Leave space for delicious desserts of green-tea crêpes or toasted tofu with ginger and cherry blossom ice cream. Named Best Asian Restaurant at the Eat Out Awards in 2014, this discreet restaurant sits cheek by jowl with a whole lot of hipster haunts in Tamboerskloof.<a href="#menu" class="visible-xs">Back To Top</a></p>
